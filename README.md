# Proj_16_Neural_Network_IMDB

# IMDB Neural Network Project

The purpose of this project is to build a neural network model using IMDB data. This model analyzes movie reviews and identifies whether the sentiment is positive or negative.

## Purpose
- To process text data using the IMDB dataset.
- To perform sentiment analysis using neural network models (such as LSTM, CNN, etc.).
- To demonstrate basic understanding and implementation of machine learning.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Converting text to numerical format using word embedding.
- Model training and validation.
- User-friendly results and analysis.

## How to Use This Project

 **Download the Code**  
   First, clone this repository:
